这是我最初学习python时的一些代码，都能正常运行，在整理代码时发现的，现在放在github上供大家参考。对应课程为北理工的[MOOC](https://www.icourse163.org/course/BIT-268001)。这些代码都是课上的项目，对于Python掌握很有帮助，建议复现一下。

This is some of the code I learned in Python at the beginning, which can run normally. I found it when I sorted out the code, and now it is put on github for your reference. The corresponding course is [MOOC](https://www.icourse163.org/course/BIT-268001) of Beijing Institute of Technology. These codes are all the items in the class, which are very helpful for mastering Python. It is recommended to reproduce them.
